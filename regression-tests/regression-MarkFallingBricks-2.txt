Setup
-----

There are several configurations of bricks that involve marking canonical bricks as falling, or not:
- brick at canonical position, with same value underneath
- brick at non-canonical position, with same value underneath
- horizontal chained bricks with a brick underneath the left brick, same value
- horizontal chained bricks with a brick underneath the left brick, different value
- horizontal chained bricks with a brick underneath the right brick, same value
- horizontal chained bricks with a brick underneath the right brick, different value
- vertical chained bricks with a brick underneath that has the same value as the bottom-most brick
- vertical chained bricks with a brick underneath that has the same value as the top-most brick

The algorithms do their thing, no user input is required.

Test
----

The bricks all start falling at the appropriate time.
