Setup
-----

There are several configurations of bricks that involve marking canonical bricks as falling, or not:
- brick at canonical position, with something underneath
- brick at non-canonical position, with something underneath
- brick at canonical position, with nothing underneath
- brick at non-canonical position, with nothing underneath
- two simple bricks overlapping perfectly at canonical position
- two horizontal chained bricks overlapping perfectly at canonical position
- two vertical chained bricks overlapping perfectly at canonical position
- two simple bricks overlapping perfectly at non-canonical position
- two horizontal chained bricks overlapping perfectly at non-canonical position
- two vertical chained bricks overlapping perfectly at non-canonical position

The algorithms do their thing, no user input is required.

Test
----

The bricks all start falling at the appropriate time.
