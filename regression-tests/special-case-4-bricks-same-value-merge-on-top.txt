Setup
-----

There are 4 bricks of the same value:
- A and B, next to each other on the ground
- C, which is falling towards A
- D, which the player drags

The player drags brick D right between A and B and holds it there. Brick D does not merge with A or B, as it is not close enough to either one. But D intersects with A and B as they all have the same value and the game allows bricks of the same value to intersect.

Brick C falls on A and merges with it, becoming a different value than B and D. Immediately after the merge, the new A intersects with D, even though they have different values.

Test
----

The situation should not result in an error or game over. The game should adjust itself in a reasonable way. The bricks should give way to each other and place themselves such that the rules of the game are respected again, as soon as possible.

The reason why this shouldn't be an error/crash case is that we do not want to change any of the rules that led to this situation.
