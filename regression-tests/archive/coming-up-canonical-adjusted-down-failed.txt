Setup
-----

The player drags a brick at the top of a 7-brick column. They let go of the brick. The dragged brick becomes canonical and starts going into position. While it is going to position, the "coming up" event is triggered.

Test
----

The "coming up" event should move the canonical brick over the top. Then, since there is no recovery possible, the game should be over.
