Setup
-----

There are bricks chained vertically, horizontally or without chains. The AllowOverlappingDrags flag is enabled and the player drags bricks around and makes them overlap.

Test
----

Every time the player lets go of a brick that now overlaps other bricks, the game moves the bricks around in what seems like a natural way, so that a final coherent state is reached where bricks rest one each other without overlapping.
